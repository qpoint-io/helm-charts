# qpoint-connect Helm chart

This deploys Qpoint Connect to Kubernetes using [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

Qpoint CONNECT is responsible to encapsulating TCP in HTTP CONNECT requests. It is designed to sit in front of the Qpoint Proxy so that CONNECT authorization can be used and ACLs can be applied to TCP traffic.
